# Functions to add in the package

-   Function that checks consistency of the person and hh data - see checks in script.

# Settings

Need to create a standard script to prepare the adm map, which uses adm_code and adm_name, not referring to the adm level


# Data
- need to split off mgr and tech when processing DHS and creating the dhs_db not in ssid scripts
- line 538 create subnational age_sex_projections: seem to use two names for agr-otherlows: agri_lowsk", "ag_othlowsk. Need to harmonize!. Even better would be to split this in agri and elementary as we do in the ML exercise.
- Preparation of national data in create_ssp_subnat_projections can be done in microsim_db repo. Better to create several global datasets, which serve as input data.
- # Calculate index
- CHeck that For a very small number of adms the ssp base year values are 0 (e.g. no urban population)
while future values are non-zero (e.g urbanization starting in 2030). This creates problems as the index number cannot be calculated. We solve this by now by setting the projections to 1 for all years in the adms where this happens. This ensures that the index is 1 throughout, base year values of the projections will be the same as the base year value and series are consistent. => check if we can turn this into a function.

NB: need to be clear how we allocate self-employed family farmers.
I would argue they are included ag_othlowsk in this case as this category captures this
But it is not clear how they are counted in other data pieces.

Check calculation of hh heads and why it differs so much in some regions (see BGD)
